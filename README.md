This is .gitlab-ci.yml used in GitLab CI to implement CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline includes the following stages:
a. Build: Compile the code for both the backend (Node.js) and frontend
(React.js). Package the application artifacts for deployment.
b. Unit Tests: Run unit tests for both backend and frontend code to ensure
individual components work as expected.
c. Static Code Analysis: Analyze the codebase for potential issues, such as
code style violations, code smells, and potential bugs.
d. Publish Docker Images:
e. Deployment: Deploy the application to the desired environment (e.g.,
staging, production).
